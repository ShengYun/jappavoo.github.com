<h1>CAS CS 591, Programmable Smart Machines</h1>
<h2>Schedule</h2>
<p>Tue,Thur 9:30-11:00 pm</p>
<h2>Course Outline</h2>
<p>
  It has been a long held goal to build machines capable of
  automatically improving based on their experience and size.
  In his 1968 paper,  <a
  href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/218019a0">"'Memo' Functions and
  Machine Learning"</a>,(Nature, vol. 218, no. 5136, pp. 19â€“22, Apr. 1968)
  Donald Michie conceretely challenged computer scientists with the
  following practical goal:
<blockquote>
  ``It would be useful if computers could learn from experience and
  thus automatically improve the efficiency of their own programs
  during execution... When I write a clumsy program for a contemporary
  computer a thousand runs on the machine do not re-educate my
  handiwork.  On every execution, each time-wasting blemish and
  crudity, each needless test and redundant evaluation, is
  meticulously reproduced.''
</blockquote>

  Over the past several years we have been developing the concept of
  Programmable Smart Machines (PSMs): Hybrid computing systems that
  behave as programmed but transparently learn and automatically
  improve their operation.  Both from the theoretical and practical 
  point of view, our work attempts to side-step the traditional bottlenecks
  associated with the von Neumann architecture while preserving its
  programming model.  
  In this course we will look at a cross section of the material
  that has informed and influenced our work including both applied and theortical
  topics.  These topics will include material from
  complexity theory, computer architecture,
  operating systems, machine learning and  biologically
  inspired computation.  A fundmental aspect of this course is
  to identify and define open questions that the work raises.
</p>
<p>
  The course will predominately be structured as a seminar in which
  each week we will be looking at one or two research papers.
  You will be required to submit weekly reviews and actively
  participate in the discussions.

<h2>Instructors</h2>
<p>Jonathan Appavoo, <a

<p>Steve Homer, and <a

<h2>Target audience</h2>
<p>This course is targeted towards
advanced undergraduate and graduate
  students.   We encourage participation of both
  theory and systems students you are willing to push
  the boundaries of what you have been thinking about.
  You are encouraged to incoporate your personal interests and
  background into the class material.
</p>
<h2>Prerequisites</h2>
<p>
  Students taking this class must have some permision from the
instructors, be a senior or graduate student and be proficient in:
</p>
<h2>Workload</h2>
<p>
  Each week we will be covering on average two research papers you
  you will be expected to read, review and discuss.  These papers
  will likely require that you find and read additional material
  as necessary to ensure your comprehension.  Do not underestimate
  the amount of work this can be.  You will be required to submit
  a written review of the papers prior to class.  You will also
  be expected to actively participate in the in class discussion.
  Each student is expected to lead one more of the class discussions
  by summarizing the paper and seeding discussions with questions
  and observations based on the paper.  
</p>
  
<p>In addition, to the weekly papers, there will be a final project.
For the project the students will explore an aspect of Programmable
Smart Machines in detail.  Projects can range from a theortical
exploration to a applied experimental evaluation.   The topic of your
project must proposed and to the instructors and be approved. You will be expected
to present a poster that discusses you project and submit a brief
written report by the end of the term.  As part of the
proposal you will be expected to establish in conjunction with the
instructors the goals and criteria for evalution.  Each week you will
provide a brief up date on the progess of your project.
</p>

<p>
The project is due by the end of the exam week. The project presentations
will be given in the form of a final poster.
</p>
<p>Students are expected to work individually on the weekly reviews.
With instructor approval the final project maybe done in groups of
two. There will be no final exam.  </p>
<p>Grading scheme:<br />
Reviews and Discussions: 40% <br />
Project: 60%<br /></p>
