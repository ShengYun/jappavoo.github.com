    I am an Assistant Professor at BU in the department of Computer
  Science.   I joined the department in the Fall of 2009.  Yes I "was
  an IBMer" at T.J. Watson Research Center.  Before that I was at the
  University of Toronto where I received my Ph.D., Dr. Michael Stumm
  was my advisor.    I am excited to be teaching and exploring all the
  "crazy" ideas that keep me up at night, while having fun with fun
  people!

  <p style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic">Research -
  Pursuing Future Computer Systems</p>

  <p style="font-style: italic">
  My interest is in pursuing how we will advance the capabilities of
  computers in the coming decades, such that new systems continue to
  dwarf the power of systems that preceded them. I am pursuing this
  along two dimensions. The first, is evolutionary in nature and the
  second, longer-term, is deconstructive and basic science in nature.
  </p>
  
  <p style="font-style: italic">
  The first aspect of my research continues to look at the evolution
  of large scale computers systems and their efficient use.  In
  project Kittyhawk we began to explore conjectures about
  cloud-computing as an evolution to market-driven global scale
  computers and computation.  In particular we explored the viability
  of advanced general purpose data-center scale systems that evolve
  from today's super-computers.  In manner, howerver, where the usage is not only
  unique because of the system massive scale and advance integrated communications but
  also its ability to elastically permit the allocation and deallocation
  of raw physical nodes in sub-second times.  We view such underlying
  systems as forming the basic resource layer of a Scalable Eastic
  Systems Architecture (SESA).  We are now looking at the role
  of operating systems software on top of such a resource layer.  We
  have identified a new elastic OS and application model, called the
  MultiLibOS, and are constructing and evaluating a specific research prototype
  called EbbOS.
  </p>
  
  <p style="font-style: italic"> During my work exploring scalable
  software models for large scale systems I have developed a machine
  model called "Programmable Smart Machines" that combines classical
  logic-based computation with pattern matching/statistical methods.
  We conjecture that this model can yield systems that can be
  programmed easily with little or no regard to the system's physical
  structure, but whose performance and function improve automatically
  with system size and ``experience''.  This conjecture and the
  various avenues for pursuing it forms the second dimension of my
  work.  I believe this conjecture is a rich area of study that may have
  the long-term potential of disruptive results that could suggest a
  new kind of general purpose programmable intelligent system that can
  be practically realized.

  <p style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic">Teaching - Clarity,
  passion and a balance between theory and practice</p>

  <p style="font-style: italic">I have three aspirational goals with
  respect to teaching.  The first is to share with students the joy
  and excitement of learning something new while helping cultivate the
  skills for self-directed discovery.  The second is to help students
  develop the technical skills necessary to achieve their goals and
  the third is to challenge students to find the beauty in all
  subjects.</p>
